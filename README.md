This has been archived as:

- due to the retiring of the GDS Observe platform, most exercises will no longer work and would need new examples written
- the workshop has not been run in a long time

1.5 hour intro workshop to Prometheus focussed on PromQL for GDS

## format

Workshop to go over the fundamentals of Prometheus. Particularly relevant to teams using Prometheus provided by Reliability Engineering.

It will be hands on. You will need to be on the VPN to access Prometheus.

Anyone can run this workshop. It seems to work well with up to 10 people so questions can be asked and help can be given. The workshop can also be done completely independently by just following the exercises.
